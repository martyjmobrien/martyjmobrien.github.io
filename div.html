        <p>After a very long period away from coding I am (finally) back.</br></p>
           
        <p>Previously I took the path of Codecademy, Learn to Program etc and whilst they were all great resources (bar some hand holding) 
           I am taking a different approach now. What I felt was lacking previously was a clear path. One which I could work through and one 
           where each step fed into the next to build and reinforce knowledge. With this in mind I am working my way through The Odin Project. 
           It is still early days but I really like how it is a) structured and b) geared around using the best of what the internet has to offer 
           and not just giving one perspective.</br></p>

        <p>An example of this was in the introductory lessons on using git. Not only did it talk about what git is, the difference between 
           git and GitHub and the basics of how to use it in the terminal but it also linked to outside resources which reinforced these ideas, 
           gave different/more thorough explanations and also went into more detailed terminology. I also find that creating a repository, 
           cloning it to your computer, seeing the files appear and seeing realtime changes when pushing to GitHub gives a much greater 
           understanding compared to Codecademy (which the Odin project actually links to as a very basic initial lesson in git).</br></p>

        <p>At the same time as this I am also still looking at the Duplicate File finding app I was making. When I left it it could only 
           add an incrementing number to the very end of the file (after the extension) and the numbers wouldn’t be specific to the file 
           dupe count, instead it would just keep counting from 1 (so eight varying dupes would result in the 8th dupe having the number eight, 
           even if there was one duplicate of that particular file). Having come back to it I realised two things:</br></p>

        <p>1: The use of File.basename was only removing the file path - I wasn’t giving it an argument to remove the extension as well.</br></p>

        <p>2: Changing the basename_array to a hash would allow me to track individual file duplications by incrementing their value.</br></p>

        <p>By implementing these changes I was able to hold the ext name in a variable, strip just the file name out, check it against the hash, 
           add the value to the end of the file, increment the value and then add the original ext name back on. Phew!</br></p>

        <p>Still more to do (such as specifying where the files are/where you want the duplicates to be saved) by it’s always nice to 
           overcome a challenge, however small!</br></p>

            <p>I finally had some time tonight to go through both the while-loops section on Learn Ruby the hard way and also update my text game on 
               GitHub with until-loops on the user inputs. I don’t think they are as clean and elegant as they could be but they work and have 
               allowed me to understand them more. With more free time I hope to flesh out the story further and as my learning continues add in 
               classes and methods.</br></p>
