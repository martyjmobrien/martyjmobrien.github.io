            <p>Duplicate File Search - <a href="https://github.com/martyjmobrien/duplicate-file" target="_blank">GitHub Project</a></p><br>
            <p>An on going project to produce an app which searches folders for duplicate files and auto renames them. 
               The app is written in ruby.</p>
            <p>This project came about after finding that Google Photos, because it doesn't use a folder system when backing up, 
               could not automatically upload all of my photos due to it assuming duplicates were succesfully uploaded photos.</p>
            <p>This is currently my main side project outside of studying. Changelogs and project projections can be found
               within the projects readme on GitHub.</p><br>

            <p>This project started off as the Javascript/jQuery assignment early on in the Odin Project curriculum but quickly expanded to incorporate a lot more ideas.</p>
            <p>I find learning through doing much more interesting as it allows me to expand my knowledge through research, trial and error and just trying to put into practise ideas I have. 
                It's come a long way from the initial assignment and I will be adding to it as I learn more.</p>
            <p>Currently I am working on adding custom modals instead of the browser standard prompts - you can read about the whole process in the blog.</p><br>
