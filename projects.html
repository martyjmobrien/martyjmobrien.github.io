            <p>An on going project to produce an app which searches folders for duplicate files and auto renames them. 
               The app is written in ruby.</p><br>
            <p>This project came about after finding that Google Photos, because it doesn't use a folder system when backing up, 
               could not automatically upload all of my photos due to it assuming duplicates were succesfully uploaded photos.</p><br>
            <p>This is currently my main side project outside of studying. Changelogs and project projections can be found
               within the projects readme on GitHub.</p>
